Regex Tutorial

This is a short tutorial on regular expressions (Regex) as a programming language. This tutorial will explain how this language is used and how it can be read. Along with understanding the language, one will understand how this method can be efficient and flexible. 

## Summary

Regular expressions (Regex) is an expression that uses various different kind of symbols the represent charcters or patterns in text. Regex can be used in almost all  programming languages used today and serves as an efficient search tool for programmers. Regex uses literal characters to represent numbers or letters and meta charcters to indicate a pattern such as positions, quantifers and classes.

For example: 
Here is an expression that is used to verify an email address:
/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/

. = any character
* = 0 or more
