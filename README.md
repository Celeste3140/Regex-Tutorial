Regex Tutorial

This is a short tutorial on regular expressions (Regex) as a programming language. This tutorial will explain how this language is used and how it can be read. Along with understanding the language, one will understand how this method can be efficient and flexible. 

## Summary

Regular expressions (Regex) is an expression that uses various different kind of symbols the represent charcters or patterns in text. Regex can be used in almost all  programming languages used today and serves as an efficient search tool for programmers. Regex uses literal characters to represent numbers or letters and meta charcters to indicate a pattern such as positions, quantifers and classes.

For example: 
Here is an expression that is used to verify an email address:
/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/

. = any character
* = 0 or more

## Regex Components
Regex expressions are made up of components that are also referred to as atoms. Some of these components include single characters such ()?+$ and / which for example is used to wrap the expression in. Other stype of components include bracket expressions, anchors, control characters and etc. 
### Anchors
Anchors are components that match an empty substring.
^ and $ are considered anchors.

^ targets string that matches characters in the beginning of string

$ targets string that matches characters in the end of string
