Regex Tutorial

This is a short tutorial on regular expressions (Regex) as a programming language. This tutorial will explain how this language is used and how it can be read. Along with understanding the language, one will understand how this method can be efficient and flexible. 

## Summary

Regular expressions (Regex) is an expression that uses various different kind of symbols the represent charcters or patterns in text. Regex can be used in almost all  programming languages used today and serves as an efficient search tool for programmers. Regex uses literal characters to represent numbers or letters and meta charcters to indicate a pattern such as positions, quantifers and classes.

For example: 
Here is an expression that is used to verify an email address:
/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/

. = any character
* = 0 or more

## Regex Components
Regex expressions are made up of components that are also referred to as atoms. Some of these components include single characters such ()?+$ and / which for example is used to wrap the expression in. Other stype of components include bracket expressions, anchors, control characters and etc. 
### Anchors
Anchors are components that match an empty substring.
^ and $ are considered anchors.

^ targets string that matches characters in the beginning of string

$ targets string that matches characters in the end of string

### Quantifiers
Quantifiers helps regex matches by setting limits to the searches. Quantifiers are greedy so they indicate that the match be maximal. A "?" can be added to the quantifier to make it non-greedy (can also be called lazy) and changes the match to be more minimal. 
Here are some quantifiers: 

"+" matches 1 or more occurrences of the pattern

"?" matches 0 or 1 occurrences of the pattern 

"*" matches 0 or more occurrences of the pattern

{} can also set limits for matches. For example:
* {6} indicates exactly 6 occurrences of the pattern will be match. 
* {6, } indicates that at least 6 occurrences of the pattern will be match.
* {6, 10} indicates between 6 and 10 occurences of the pattern will be match. 

### OR Operator
OR Operators (|) require the string to meet all requirements in the pattern. For example: 

* (123) : (abc) we have this expression that will match each character individually 

* (1|2|3) : (a|b|c) using the OR operator this expression match every character 

### Character Classes
Character classes matches a single character out of several ones. 

. mactches any single character 

\d matches any numerical digit, same as [0-9]

\s matches any whitespace character 

\w any numerical or alpanumeric character including "_"

### Flags

### Grouping and Capturing

### Bracket Expressions

Bracket Expressions [] represent a series of characters that are going to be match. Any single character inside the bracket expression is matched with the target string.

For example we have this bracket expression [jkl], it will look for a string that includes any of those letters in the bracket expression. 

Another example, we have this bracket expression [3-5], it will search for any number between 3-5.
